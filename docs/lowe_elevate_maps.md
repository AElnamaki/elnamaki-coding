# 🔁 Lowe and Elevate Operators in Elnamaki Coding

Elnamaki Coding is built upon symbolic topologies where each number is part of a **recursive sequence**,  
but more deeply, part of a **semantic structure** that evolves across dimensions.

To move between layers of this recursive space, we define two essential operations:

## 🔽 `Lowe`: Project Down to Prior Dimension

The **Lowe** operator reduces the recursive embedding of a number, effectively **lowering it** into a prior dimension  
of recursive memory. Given a seed $(x, y)$ and a recursive identity $(F_{n}, F_{n+1})$,  
Lowe transforms the seed down in the Fibonacci basis.

### **Mathematical Form:**

Let:
- $(x, y)$ be the current seed
- $(F_n, F_{n+1})$ be the identity basis

Then:

$$
\texttt{Lowe}(x, y; F_n, F_{n+1}) =
\left( x \bmod F_n, \quad y + \left\lfloor \frac{x}{F_n} \right\rfloor \cdot F_{n+1} \right)
$$

This can be seen as a **left shift** of Zeckendorf structure  
with the remainder descending and quotient pushing the elevation of $y$.

## 🔼 `Elevate`: Expand to Higher Dimensional Structure

The **Elevate** operator takes a lower-dimensional recursive form and expands it into a higher structure.

Given a seed and identity, `Elevate` reverses the lowering, increasing the complexity and recursive depth.

### **Mathematical Form:**

Let:
- $(x', y')$ be the result of `Lowe`
- We wish to reconstruct the higher layer

Then:

$$
x = x' + q \cdot F_n \\
y = y' - q \cdot F_{n+1}
$$

where:

$$
q = \left\lfloor \frac{y' - y}{F_{n+1}} \right\rfloor
$$

## 🧠 Intuition

- **Lowe** moves toward a **more compressed** representation.
- **Elevate** restores the **full generative path** from compact form.
- Together, they provide **bidirectional navigation** through the recursive lattice.

This is analogous to **dimensional descent/ascent** in manifold learning or neural representation,  
but applied to **recursive symbolic topologies**.

## 🧪 Example

```python
def lowe_elevate_expansion(seed: Tuple[int, int], identity: Tuple[int, int]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    x, y = seed
    fn1, fn = identity

    q = x // fn
    r = x % fn
    x_prime = r
    y_prime = y + q * fn1

    return [(x_prime, y_prime), (x, y)]  # Lowe then Elevate recovery
